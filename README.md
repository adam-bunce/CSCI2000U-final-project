## Introduction
What makes a student successful? Is it how long they study? How frequently do they skip school? Or is it just based on how naturally gifted they are. To answer these questions, we used a Kaggle Dataset that consists of 395 secondary student's scores in math and Portuguese language courses obtained through a survey. Along with this we are given information about the student's; age, sex, internet access, drinking habits, family situation, study habits and several other features. 




## Discussion 
- You should pick and choose the most interesting findings of you research based on your 
data analysis. You will offer evidence of those findings by adding selected information. 
This is your discussion, this should be at least 50% of your report.
- You will only present the evidence to add to the narrative. The computation and 
creation of graphs will reserved to your technical report.

## Conclusion
- You should conclude your report.
  - In the discussion, you are presenting the findings. In the conclusion you will 
summarize what was discussed. To help you structure your conclusion:
  - You should have a “Reflection” (list things you learned as you worked on 
the project) and “Refinement” (if you were to improve the project, what 
would be the next steps) subsection in the conclusion.
